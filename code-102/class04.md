### Structure web pages with HTML

## Wireframes and Design

We create wireframes and designs before coding for a web page, as it allows us to plan ahead. Additionally, having a solid reference of your ideas/vision allows you to work quicker as well as to illustrate your ideas better to other people.

_Things to keep in mind:_

- Wireframes can be created by hand (sketching) or digitally (through websites such as [figma](https://www.figma.com/))

- It's best to keep initial designs simple, I want to master the core concepts without overwhelming myself.

- Try to think about how you would like the user to navigate your page

## HTML

HTML(.html) is a markup language like Markdown(.md). It is considered the backbone of a website, containing all the core information.

You build your page using elements called <tags>

**The basic structure of a HTML file would consist of:**

- **<head></head>:** Head tags contain the 'background' information for the website.
- **<body></body>:** Body tags contain all the text and information of the web page that is visible.
- **<header></header>:** The first sub-section of the body. For banners for example.
- **<main></main>:** The second sub-section of the body.
- **<footer></footer>:** Last sub-section of the body. Footer tags contain the sub text of the website, such as copyright info.
