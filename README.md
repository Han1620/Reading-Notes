### **Who am I**? <sub> ...and what are my interests? </sub>

### **What is Growth Mindset**?
Growth mindset is a learning appraoch. Meaning you have the ability to learn things that you do not currently know.

### What will be my reminders to maintain a growth mindset?

1. Remembering past achievements.
   - I have previously learned many new skills, so I know that I have the capacity. For instance, I learned to glass blow in a week, and I learned wood-turning in a day. 

2. I will set small clear goals to achieve, and acknowledge my improvement.
   - Small goals mean I wont be overwhelmed with my tasks.

3. To avoid using pessimistic language surrounding my abilities/learning journey.
   - A positive mental attitude to challenging tasks/mistakes makes learning more fun/easier.
