# Reading-Notes

### Who am I?
Hi, my name is Hannah. I am new to coding, and excited to learn. 
I like art, playing sports and puzzles!

### What is this website?
This is my reading notes for the full stack bootcamp.

### What is Growth Mindset?
Growth mindset is the approach that you have the ability to learn things that you do not currently know.

### What will be my reminders to maintain a growth mindset?

1. I have previously learned many new skills, so I know that I have the capacity. For instance, I laerned to glass blow in a week, and I learned wood-turning in a day. 

2. I will set small clear goals to achieve, and acknowledge my improvement.

3. To avoid using pessimistic language surrounding my abilities/learning journey.
